PROGRAM USE: User can select an image to upload, which gets stored into the 'Uploads' folder, and can be viewed on the gallery page.
There is a link to the homepage and the gallery page for better navigation.

GITHUB REPOSITORY: https://github.com/EduardoVillasenor1992/205final

FUTURE WORK: We originally intended to have the user apply a filter to the images uploaded, but we were unable to complete the goal. In the future this is something that 
would be great to add, as well as being able to dsiplay the filtered images on the next webpage.
